Port of bkobkobko SparkTimeAlarms with an update that the number of timers can be 255 (versus only 6)

Comment from bkobkobko's port

Port of PJRC's TimeAlarms Library using core Time.now

Please note that this library is not intended to work with the SparkTime NTP library.

This library only works with built-in core Time.now() initialized from the Spark Cloud.
